To eliminate supervisors as a cause of turnover, you need to ask:

Has he or she received adequate training?
Does one supervisor have more or less turnover than another?
Is turnover high on one shift or in one location but good in another?
Does the supervisor have performance goals that include retention, turnover, and employee engagement?
To evaluate other potential causes of turnover, ask:

Are employees leaving after three to five years or during their first 12 months?
Are you providing millennials enough opportunities to learn?
Are you providing generation X enough opportunities to advance?
Are your wages and benefits competitive â€¦ and do they meet the needs of a multi-generation workforce?


Causes of employee turnover

    - Rude behavior.
    - Work-life imbalance.
    - The job did not meet expectations.
    - Employee misalignment.
    - Feeling undervalued.
    - Coaching and feedback are lacking.
    - Decision-making ability is lacking.
    - People skills are inadequate.
    - Organizational instability.
    - Raises and promotions frozen.
    - Faith and confidence shaken.
    - Growth opportunities not available.
